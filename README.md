# Analyze-AB-Test-Results
this project was part of Udacity's Nanodegree Program 
# Project Details

For this project, a company developed an e-commerce website to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.
The goal is to understand A\B testing to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
# Results
There was no sufficient evidence found to suggest that the new page converts better than the old one.

# Tools

- Python (Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook
